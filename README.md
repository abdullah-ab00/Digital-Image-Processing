This repo will contain all the work I've done in Image Processing.
Currently I'm working on a Desktop Application. The application is a basic Image Editing Software. That can be used to perform Image Processing.
This project is done in Python using the library called PyQt6. All you have to do is compile and run the editor.py file.

**March 8th, 2024:**   I've Uploaded a project that lets you upload an image and perform some Image Processing techniques. For now it is limited to Binary Thresholding
